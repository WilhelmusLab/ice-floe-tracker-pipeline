# Development Guide

We have found VSCode to be a good IDE for development. You can use the [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) configuration to initialize a virtual machine with the Julia, Python and the geospatial dependencies for this project. 

Before running any Julia code for the first time, follow the instructions in 
[PythonSetupForIFTPipeline.jl](./PythonSetupForIFTPipeline.jl/README.md) 
to initialize a working Conda environment.

Follow the instructions in [IFTPipeline.jl](./IFTPipeline.jl/) to run the tests of the pipeline.
